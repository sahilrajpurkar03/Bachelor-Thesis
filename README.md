## Controlled Motion of a Pneumatic Quadruped Robot 
This project involves the design, control, and testing of a pneumatic quadruped robot developed in collaboration with Mercury Pneumatic Pvt. Ltd. The robot features two active degrees of freedom per leg and implements walking and pronking gaits using custom C++ control algorithms. The study evaluates robot dynamics and controllability, with a focus on seamless hardware integration, including a customized PCB design.
